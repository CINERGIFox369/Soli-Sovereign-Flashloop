2. **Azure Key Vault Integration** ✅ - Enterprise-grade secret management
3. **Environment Variable Warnings** ✅ - Clear warnings about insecure fallbacks
4. **Key Rotation Support** ✅ - Migration tools for secure key updates

### Security Best Practices Implemented
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Azure Key Vault permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple fallback authentication methods
- **Secure Defaults**: DRY_RUN mode enforced without explicit confirmation
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for all security operations

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Enhanced Market Monitoring
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Rolling 24-hour windows for gas/volatility history
- **Adaptive Sampling**: 5-minute intervals for real-time responsiveness
- **Intelligent Caching**: DEX configuration caching to reduce API calls

### Multi-DEX Efficiency  
- **Priority-based Routing**: Higher priority DEXs checked first
- **Parallel Quote Fetching**: Simultaneous quotes from multiple DEXs
- **Network-aware Routing**: Automatic network detection and appropriate DEX selection

### Dashboard Performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO for efficient data streaming
- **Selective Updates**: Only changed data transmitted to frontend
- **Chart Optimization**: Chart.js with data decimation for large datasets
