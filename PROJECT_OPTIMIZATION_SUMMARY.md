- **Market Monitoring**: Efficient 24-hour rolling window data management
- **Dashboard Efficiency**: Real-time Socket.IO updates with selective data transmission
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and bounded data structures

### 4. Architecture Improvements
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between keeper, dashboard, security, and configuration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with detailed logging
- **Failover Systems**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- **Circuit Breakers**: Intelligent risk management with automatic recovery

### 5. Dependency Optimization
