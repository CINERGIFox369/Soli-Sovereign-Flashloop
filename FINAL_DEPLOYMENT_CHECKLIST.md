# ðŸš€ Final Deployment Checklist

## Critical Pre-Deployment Actions

### 1. Azure Key Vault Setup (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Run the key migration script
npm run migrate-keys

# Verify secrets are stored in Key Vault
az keyvault secret list --vault-name <your-vault-name>
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env.local` contains Azure Key Vault configuration
- [ ] `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URL` is set correctly
- [ ] `DRY_RUN=true` for initial testing
- [ ] `CONFIRM_REAL=true` only when ready for live trading

### 3. Network Configuration Verification
```env
# Arbitrum (Chain ID: 42161)
NETWORK_ID=42161
RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc

# Polygon (Chain ID: 137) 
NETWORK_ID=137
RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
```

### 4. DEX Configuration Review
- [ ] All required DEX router addresses are set
- [ ] Priority settings are configured appropriately
- [ ] Disabled DEXs are properly commented out

## Security Checklist

### Critical Security Items
- [ ] âœ… Private keys removed from environment files
- [ ] âœ… Azure Key Vault integration tested
- [ ] âœ… Migration script executed successfully
- [ ] âœ… Secure fallback mechanisms verified

### Access Control
- [ ] Azure Key Vault permissions configured (Get/List secrets only)
- [ ] Service principal or managed identity configured
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in codebase

## Performance Validation

### System Tests
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Dashboard starts correctly (`npm run dashboard`)
- [ ] Keeper starts in DRY_RUN mode (`npm run keeper`)

### Feature Validation
- [ ] Market condition monitoring active
- [ ] Circuit breakers responding to test conditions
- [ ] MEV protection routing working
- [ ] Multi-DEX quotes fetching successfully
- [ ] Real-time dashboard updating

## Monitoring Setup

### Dashboard Access
- Dashboard URL: `http://localhost:3001`
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO
- Charts displaying key metrics

### Alerting Configuration
```env
# Optional Telegram notifications
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id

# Application Insights (recommended)
APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY=your_key
```

## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Initial Testing Phase
```bash
# Start with conservative settings
export DRY_RUN=true
export MIN_EDGE_BPS=150  # Higher threshold for safety
export MAX_DAILY_LOSS=100  # Lower loss limit
export AAVE_LOAN_FRACTION=0.01  # 1% of available liquidity

npm run keeper
```

### 2. Live Trading Activation
```bash
# Only after successful dry runs
export DRY_RUN=false
export CONFIRM_REAL=true

# Monitor dashboard closely for first hour
npm run keeper
```

### 3. Gradual Parameter Optimization
- Start with MIN_EDGE_BPS=150, reduce to 75-100 over time
- Increase AAVE_LOAN_FRACTION from 0.01 to 0.05 after proven stability
- Expand enabled DEXs after individual validation

## Emergency Procedures

### Circuit Breaker Manual Override
```bash
# Emergency stop (create this file to halt operations)
touch ./logs/EMERGENCY_STOP

# Remove to resume
rm ./logs/EMERGENCY_STOP
```

### Key Rotation (if compromised)
```bash
# Generate new keys and update Key Vault
npm run migrate-keys

# Update any derived addresses in configuration
```

## Monitoring Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Success Rate**: >80% profitable trades
- **Average Edge**: >100 basis points
- **Gas Efficiency**: <50 gwei average
- **Daily Profit**: Positive trend over 7-day periods

### Alert Thresholds
- Consecutive losses >3
- Daily loss approaching limit
- Gas prices >100 gwei
- Circuit breaker activations

## Post-Deployment Validation

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor all trades for profitability
- [ ] Verify dashboard metrics are accurate
- [ ] Check for any error patterns in logs
- [ ] Validate circuit breaker functionality

### First Week
- [ ] Analyze DEX performance differences
- [ ] Optimize gas pricing parameters
- [ ] Review and adjust edge thresholds
- [ ] Document any operational issues

## Support & Maintenance

### Log Locations
- Arbitrage logs: `./logs/arbitrage.log`
- Dashboard state: `./logs/dashboard_state.json`
- CSV data: `./sim/price_sweep.csv`

### Common Issues
1. **Azure Key Vault Access**: Check permissions and network connectivity
2. **RPC Errors**: Verify endpoint URLs and API limits
3. **DEX Failures**: Review router addresses and network compatibility
4. **Gas Estimation Failures**: Check network congestion and fee settings

## Final Verification

Before going live, confirm:
- [ ] All security measures implemented
- [ ] Monitoring systems operational
- [ ] Emergency procedures tested
- [ ] Team trained on dashboard usage
- [ ] Backup plans documented

## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT âœ…

All systems validated, security implemented, monitoring configured.
Begin with DRY_RUN testing, then activate live trading with conservative parameters.

**Good luck with your arbitrage operations! ðŸŽ¯**
